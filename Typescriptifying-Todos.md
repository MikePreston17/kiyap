## Steps for turning this project into a Typescript/TSX/Next based app:

- [ ] Add typescript support libraries and copy over TPOT-Next's Tslint
- [x] Follow the Next JS conversion guides (any)
- [ ] Test that you can still sign in, register, etc before merging into `develop` branch.
- [ ] Convert minor components to TSX.
- [ ] * Optional * upload ea. TSX component to your Bit.dev account.
- [ ] Add next js support and test run + build.
- [ ] Add netlify support and test deploy.
- [x] Move webpack support for dotenv (.env files) into next.config.js so React can use .env files with Nextjs.
